It's a sad, strange film with characters who say things like, \"there are no happy endings because nothing ends\" and \"I can feel this body dying all around me!\" (Also: \"oh god, I'm engaged to a Douglas fir!\") It explores enchantment in both the sense of losing it – losing our innocence – and as a state we find ourselves in all too easily when we lose our way: we become 'not ourselves'."

For the three years prior, I'd had a box of art materials in the corner that sat there and looked at me while I worked on a writing project that ultimately went nowhere. I suppressed the visual side of me for a long, painful time. And then in a situation where I could not speak my feelings or approach them directly, I started a random, 'meaningless' painting. I worked on it for a few weeks, then put it away. Then started another painting. Then another. I was thinking about endings, and violent beginnings, and feeling hope and desperation, and groping, by accident, in the right direction. It still perhaps means nothing at all. Except that just doing it marked a change in me. ",

This piece draws heavily on what was happening for me at the time: grief, a loss of identity, a hope for rebirth, and an urge to paint a new self into existence.",

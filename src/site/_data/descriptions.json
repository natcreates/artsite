    "description": "Done for Inktober 2019 and inspired by the 1982 animated film, 'The Last Unicorn'. This was my favourite film as a child and it's still something I watch when I'm feeling lost. It's a sad, strange film with characters who say things like, \"there are no happy endings because nothing ends\" and \"I can feel this body dying all around me!\" (Also: \"oh god, I'm engaged to a Douglas fir!\") It explores enchantment in both the sense of losing it – losing our innocence, our unicorns – and as a state we find ourselves in all too easily when we lose our way: we become 'not ourselves'. It's possible to lose both our faith and who we are, and there was a point when I watched this film and realised I'd lost both. I'm still busy trying to free myself from one enchantment and find another. Drawing helps.",

    "description": "I started this painting later 2018 in a state of shock, as something to do, using paints I'd never touched before. I didn't plan a concept, I just started painting a face looking up. For the three years prior, I'd had a box of art materials in the corner that sat there and looked at me while I worked on a writing project that ultimately went nowhere: the 'serious' project that it was not acceptable to take time away from, and even less acceptable to make imperfect - or real at all. I suppressed the visual side of me for a long, painful time. \nAnd then in a situation where I could not speak my feelings or approach them directly, I started a random, meaningless painting. I worked on it for a few weeks, then put it away. Then started another painting. Then another. I was thinking about endings, and violent beginnings, and feeling hope and desperation, and groping, by accident, in the right direction. It still perhaps means nothing at all. Except that just doing it marked a change in me. ",
